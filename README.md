# Django-Blog-
A simple Django Blog built to help myself and other developers practice working with a REST API. This blog is automatically updated everyday at 8am using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). The script is hosted and automatically triggered on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Getting Started 🏁

[Website](http://www.api-arrayly.xyz/)

You can hook into this API by following the instructions I have given on the [documentation page](http://www.api-arrayly.xyz/overview/). I recommend that you practice with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) first before integrating it into your own application.

### Prerequisites 🔑

In order to use the API, you require an authentication token. Contact me on my [main website](https://arrayly.com/contact/) expressing your reasons for wanting to use the API and the email address you have registered with. I will then generate an authentication token and contact you ASAP.
